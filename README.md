The overall sentiment score I had gotten for this is 0.09977168072089947 which was the average of all the lines scores combined. 
The sentimental analysis score is on a scale from -1 to 1. -1 being very negative and 1 being a very positive.
To my understanding what this score means to me is that the text overall was a very nuetral text but slightly waying towards the positive side.
The score I expected was close to 0 and I say this because when I was manually looking through the text it seemed like many lines were taking a nuetral stand point.

The libraries used were TextBlob and nltk
